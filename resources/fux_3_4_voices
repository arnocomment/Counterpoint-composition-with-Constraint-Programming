# Fux's counterpoint for 3 and 4 voices

Analysis based on *The Study of Counterpoint - Gradus Ad Parnassum* from *Johann Joseph Fux*, translated and edited by *Alfred Mann*

The counterpoint rules for 2 voices composing are described in Thibault Wafflard's work.  Most of the rules for 2 voices are kept for 3 voices & more, unless specified.  Italic phrases mean that they are citations from the book (english & french traduction).

### Note against note in Three Parts (species 1)

"*That three part composition is the most perfect of all is already evident from the fact that in it one can have a complete **harmonic triad** without adding another voice.  If a fourth voice or more voices are added, this is, so to speak, only a repetition of another voice already present in the **harmonic triad***". (p.71)

*"Three whole notes in each instance, the **upper two being consonant with the lowest**"* (p.71)
$\rightarrow$ Ensure consonance with the lower note.  

*"it is to be observed first of all that the **harmonic triad** should be employed in every measure if there is no special reason against it."*
"What is the **harmonic triad**?" - *"It is a combination of the intervals of the third and fifth (...)"* (p.71)
$\rightarrow$ Use harmonic triad whenever it is possible

| *"why is it sometimes impossible to use this triad?"* - *Occasionally, for a better melodic line, one uses a consonance not properly belonging to the triad, namely a sixth or an octave.  More often the necessity of avoiding the succession of two perfect consonances demands the giving up of the triad and the use of a sixth instead of the fifth, or of an octave, or both of them*. (p.72) | "*D'abord, l'élégance du chant qui exige souvent de substituer à l'harmonie parfaite une autre consonnance, telle que la Sixte ou l'Octave.  Ensuite, on est obligé d'éviter de mettre deux parfaites de suite de manière que l'on doit dans ce cas là mettre la Sixte ou l'Octave à la place de la quinte*" |

$\rightarrow$ there is some flexibility to avoid the succession of two perfect consonances (i think this is from P1 : "*perfect consonances cannot be reached by direct motion*").  There is also a footnote : "i.e., (1-3-6) or (1-3-8) or (1-6-8) instead of (1-3-5)". They explain that both (1-3-8) and (1-6-8) are considered equal in use, even though the root is changed.
$\rightarrow$ IMO P1 cannot be kept as a hard constraint and has to be expressed as a preference, since 3&4 parts counterpoint is far more permissive  
$\rightarrow$ In this example, it is possible to keep a triad in the second measure.  However, Aloys, the master, has a response to why he has not done it

| *"my example (...) follows the natural order and the principle of variety more closely.  It takes the natural order more strictly into account because the tenor moves down gracefully, stepwise without any skip, through the third measure where there is a sixth"* |                    |

## Discussion / Questions

This point addresses the blurry points of Fux's theory.  The points refer to the above described rules in the way (voices/species).

* consonance between middle & high note ? (3/1)
