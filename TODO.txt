TODO (for 1st species to be complete)

- range of CP : thibault fixed to one and a half octave (18 semitones) for performance reasons
- cost of borrowed notes
- first species : only one list of notes is needed, 0 values are in the way -> get rid of them?
		-> cantus firmus is always full notes so is there really a need to consider it as an array?
		-> same for H & H_abs, most of the variables are not "used"




DONE

- all notes from same key
- some borrowed notes are allowed
